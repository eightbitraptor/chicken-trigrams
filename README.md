# Trigrams Kata - in Chicken Scheme

Because LOLZORZ!!!

1. This is the first non trivial thing I have attempted in Scheme
2. Be warned...
3. I am not responsible if your computer dies in a fireball.

## Well, ok then

If you really want to run it - you can run the specs by issuing the following commands (assuming you already have chicken scheme installed)

    $> chicken-install missbehave
    $> behave trigram_spec.scm

Useful compilation instructions coming soon. Maybe.

Don't judge me
