# Trigrams Kata - in Chicken Scheme

Because LOLZORZ!!!

1. This is the first non trivial thing I have attempted in Scheme
2. This takes **ages** to run.
3. Be warned...
4. I am not responsible if your computer dies in a fireball.
5. ... seriously, mine kept my whole house warm while this was running!

## Well, ok then

If you really want to run it - you can run the specs by issuing the following commands (assuming you already have chicken scheme installed)

    $> chicken-install missbehave
    $> behave trigram_spec.scm

Alternatively you can run it in a compiled form

    $> csc trigrams.scm
    $> cat some-text.txt | ./trigrams

Don't judge me
